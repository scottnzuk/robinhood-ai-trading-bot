# Advanced Modular Debugging & Timeout Framework Design

## Overview
Design a modular, configurable debugging and testing framework with fine-grained timeout controls to detect, isolate, and report unresponsive or stalled async processors within the AI trading system.

## Key Components
- **Timeout Decorators:** Async-compatible wrappers to enforce per-call timeouts.
- **Watchdog Manager:** Supervises long-running tasks, cancels or flags on timeout.
- **Failure Isolation:** Cancels or isolates stalled processors without crashing system.
- **Diagnostic Reporter:** Logs detailed timeout events, stack traces, and system state.
- **Integration Hooks:** Seamless with existing logging, error handling, and fallback.
- **Customizable Policies:** Per-module/function timeout configs, escalation rules.
- **Test Harness:** Injects artificial stalls to validate timeout detection.
- **Metrics Exporter:** Sends timeout stats to Prometheus/Grafana.

## Design Details
- Use `asyncio.wait_for()` in decorators for fine-grained async timeout control.
- Watchdog runs as a background async task, monitoring all critical coroutines.
- On timeout:
  - Cancel stalled task
  - Log traceback and context
  - Trigger fallback or retry logic
  - Escalate alerts if persistent
- Configurable via YAML/JSON:
  - Timeout thresholds per function/module
  - Retry/escalation policies
  - Notification channels
- Integrate with existing:
  - `tenacity` retry logic (timeouts trigger retries)
  - `ratelimit` (timeouts respect rate limits)
  - Logging system (color-coded, timestamped)
  - Test suite (simulate stalls, verify detection)

## Implementation Phases
1. **Timeout Decorators:** Wrap critical async functions.
2. **Watchdog Manager:** Monitor and cancel stalled tasks.
3. **Diagnostic Reporting:** Detailed logs on timeout events.
4. **Integration:** Hook into retries, fallbacks, error handling.
5. **Testing:** Simulate stalls, validate detection and recovery.
6. **Metrics:** Export stats for monitoring dashboards.

## Benefits
- Proactive detection of unresponsive processors
- Faster troubleshooting with detailed diagnostics
- Improved fault isolation and resilience
- Seamless integration with existing architecture
- Configurable, modular, and extensible design
