# Autonomous Crypto Trading System - Master Architecture

*Consolidated Blueprint - Generated 2025-04-07*

---

## 🚀 Core Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Isolated, swappable components (not docker-dependent)
- **Extensibility:** Plugin system for data sources, strategies, models (YAML/JSON configs)
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breakers, dead man’s switch, graceful degradation
- **Performance:** Sub-10ms latency for HFT, async swing processing
- **Transparency:** Real-time dashboards (Grafana), audit logs (S3/Elastic)
- **Continuous Learning:** Auto-backtesting, online updates
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Rate limits, wash trade detection

---

## 🏗 Architecture Layers & Components

### 1. Data Fabric

- **Multi-Exchange Ingestion:** Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, CoinGecko, TradingView
- **Real-Time + Historical:** WebSocket prioritized (<50ms latency), REST fallback
- **Geodistributed Nodes:** AWS Tokyo, Frankfurt, NYC
- **Data Integrity Layer:**
  - Triangulation Engine (cross-validate ≥3 exchanges)
  - Outlier Auto-Correction
  - Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Alerts
- **Latency Optimizer:** Drop REST if WebSocket lags
- **Specialized Storage:**
  - Redis Streams (order books)
  - Parquet + DuckDB (columnar queries)
- **Validation Rules:**
  - Price discrepancy >0.2% triggers alert
  - Z-score filtering, volume spike verification
  - Timestamp sync to Binance

---

### 2. Analytics & Intelligence

- **Multi-Resolution Ensemble:**
  - 1s (HFT), 1m (momentum), 1h (trend)
- **Market Regime Detector:** Bull/Bear/Range/Volatile
- **Liquidity Forecaster:** Slippage prediction
- **Confidence Scoring:** Weighted factors (multi-TF, volume, whale activity, macro, Sharpe)
- **Feature Engineering:** EMAs, RSI, MACD, VWAP, TWAP, candle patterns, whale alerts
- **Model Training & Deployment:** Walk-forward validation, continuous retraining

---

### 3. Strategy & Execution

- **Dynamic Strategy Allocation:** HFT vs. swing sizing
- **Anti-Gaming Measures:** Iceberg orders, randomized delays, exchange-specific tactics
- **Real-Time Risk Engine:** Max drawdown halt, blacklist illiquid symbols
- **Order Management:** Broker abstraction, simulation, paper, live modes
- **Execution Monitoring:** Slippage, latency, fill status

---

### 4. Orchestration & Monitoring

- **Priority Scheduling:** Real-time vs. batch
- **Self-Healing Pipeline:** Auto-retry, data replay
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Alerts, emergency override
- **Dashboards & Logs:** Grafana, Elastic, S3, daily reports

## 🎯 Phase 1 Tactical Priorities

- ✅ Data Fabric MVP: Binance/Kraken WebSocket, triangulation, anomaly detection
- ✅ Alpha Signals: EMA crossover, RSI divergence, OI liquidation hunting
- ✅ Execution Skeleton: Paper trading, slippage modeling, daily reports
- ❌ Real-time streaming upgrades
- ❌ Automated trade execution
- ❌ Continuous learning pipeline
- ❌ Advanced risk management
- 🔴 **Distributed message bus & multi-agent scaling — HIGHEST PRIORITY**

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Institutional tools (CME gap, T-1 settlement)
- LLM sentiment integration
- RL for dynamic sizing
- Automated tax lot compliance
- UI/dashboard enhancements
