# Implementation & Analytics Roadmap

*Consolidated Plan - Generated 2025-04-07*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Multi-source, multi-timeframe crypto data ingestion
- Advanced analytics combining technicals & sentiment
- Parallelized AI inference and ranking
- Automated, explainable trade recommendations
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Real-time streaming, backtesting, and execution

---

## 1. Data Ingestion & Streaming

- ✅ Multi-threaded/multi-core fetching of candlestick data (REST + WebSocket)
- ✅ Hugging Face NLP datasets for sentiment
- ✅ Real-time streaming upgrades (Binance, Coinbase, social feeds)
- ✅ Incremental feature updates on new data ticks
- ✅ **Multi-exchange WebSocket ingestion prototype complete**
- ✅ **Data published to Redis and stored in ClickHouse**
- ✅ **Materialized views created for Grafana dashboards**

---

## 2. Sentiment & NLP Integration

- ✅ Batch sentiment analysis using Trading-Hero-LLM
- ✅ Aggregate sentiment scores per symbol/timeframe
- ❌ Stream sentiment sources (Twitter, Reddit, news feeds)
- ❌ Sentiment-symbol mapping refinement

---

## 3. Feature Engineering & Analytics

- ✅ Technical indicators: EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, VWAP, TWAP
- ✅ Candlestick pattern recognition
- ✅ Sentiment aggregation
- ✅ Cross-referenced analytics: correlation, trend strength, volatility, anomaly detection
- ✅ Confidence scoring matrix (multi-factor)
- ❌ Sliding window analytics for real-time detection

---

## 4. Ranking & Reporting

- ✅ Parallelized model inference
- ✅ Ensemble methods (statistical + ML + sentiment)
- ✅ Ranking algorithm (trend, sentiment, volatility, liquidity, anomalies)
- ✅ Markdown/JSON report generation
- ✅ Top N buy recommendations with rationale
- ❌ Configurable report frequency & formats

---

## 5. Backtesting Framework

- ❌ Historical data replay
- ❌ Plug-in analytics pipeline during replay
- ❌ Strategy performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, win rate)
- ❌ Parameter optimization
- ❌ Integration with `backtesting.py` or custom engine
- 🔴 **Design backtesting API and data flow — HIGH PRIORITY**

---

## 6. Automated Trade Execution

- ❌ Broker API integration (Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood)
- ❌ Order management (market, limit, stop-loss)
- ❌ Risk controls (position sizing, max loss, exposure)
- ❌ Execution monitoring (slippage, latency, fills)
- ❌ Simulation mode before live deployment
- 🔴 **Define broker integration interface — HIGH PRIORITY**

---

## 7. Continuous Learning & Model Retraining

- ❌ Auto-label trade outcomes
- ❌ Scheduled retraining
- ❌ Walk-forward validation
- ❌ Model versioning and rollback
- ❌ Online incremental learning
- ❌ Hyperparameter tuning
- ❌ Performance monitoring

---

## 8. UI / Dashboard

- ❌ Live visualization of data, sentiment, analytics
- ❌ Historical charts with signals/trades
- ❌ Configurable alerts
- ❌ Backtest results visualization
- ❌ User controls for strategy parameters
- 🔴 **Plan UI/dashboard wireframes — HIGH PRIORITY**

---

## 9. Infrastructure, Monitoring & Testing

- ✅ Containerization (Docker)
- ✅ Task orchestration (Celery, Ray, Airflow)
- ✅ Logging & monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ Error handling, retries, alerts
- ✅ Scalability (multi-core, multi-node)
- ❌ API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- ❌ Unit & integration tests
- ❌ Performance benchmarks
- ❌ User guides

---

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

- 🔴 Prototype WebSocket streaming ingestion
- 🔴 Design backtesting API
- 🔴 Define broker integration interface
- 🔴 Plan UI/dashboard wireframes
- 🔴 Expand test coverage
