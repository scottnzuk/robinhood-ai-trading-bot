# Scaling & Optimization Plan

*Consolidated Strategy - Generated 2025-04-07*

---

## 🌐 Multi-Agent Distributed Architecture

- ❌ Multiple autonomous agents per exchange/asset/strategy
- 🔴 **Implement distributed message bus (ZeroMQ, Redis) — HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- ❌ Central coordinator:
  - Health monitoring
  - Risk aggregation
  - Orchestration
- ❌ Horizontal scaling across servers/nodes
- ❌ Hot failover and redundancy
- ❌ Geodistributed deployment (Tokyo, Frankfurt, NYC)

---

## ⚡ Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Intelligence

- ❌ Real-time price triangulation
- ❌ Latency-optimized arbitrage execution
- ❌ Adaptive spread thresholds
- ❌ Risk-aware capital allocation
- ❌ Anomaly detection and filtering

---

## 🤖 Federated Learning Pipeline

- ❌ Local model training on agent data
- ❌ Share model updates, not raw data
- ❌ Aggregate updates centrally (FedAvg)
- ❌ Continuous, privacy-preserving learning
- ❌ Model versioning and rollback

---

## 🛡 Advanced Risk Management

- ❌ Dynamic position sizing (volatility, confidence, exposure)
- ❌ Real-time portfolio risk tracking
- ❌ Max drawdown, max loss, exposure enforcement
- ❌ Circuit breakers on breach
- ❌ Adaptive stop-loss/take-profit
- ❌ Dynamic asset blacklisting
- ❌ Anomaly-triggered risk adjustments

---

## 🔄 Self-Optimization

- ❌ Runtime profiling (latency, memory)
- ❌ Leak detection, GC tuning
- ❌ Bottleneck elimination
- ❌ Adaptive resource allocation
- ❌ Logging of optimization actions

---

## 🧠 Continuous Learning & Adaptation

- ❌ Auto-label trade outcomes
- ❌ Scheduled retraining
- ❌ Walk-forward validation
- ❌ Online incremental learning
- ❌ Hyperparameter tuning

---

## 🗺 Next Steps for Scaling & Optimization

- 🔴 **Implement distributed message bus (ZeroMQ, Redis)**
- 🔴 **Develop agent lifecycle management**
- 🔴 **Integrate arbitrage intelligence**
- 🔴 **Build federated learning pipeline**
- 🔴 **Test multi-agent failover and scaling**
- ❌ Integrate advanced risk engine
- ❌ Enable self-optimization routines
