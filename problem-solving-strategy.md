# Problem-Solving Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines a detailed problem-solving strategy for coding issues. The strategy is applicable to a range of situations, from creating a poetic piece of code to resolving a recurring bug in a web development project, or devising an efficient algorithm to solve a complex problem.

## Steps

### 1. Research Potential Solutions
- Conduct thorough research on potential solutions.
- Gather information from various sources such as forums, communities, and academic papers.

### 2. Rank Solutions
- Rank the identified solutions based on complexity, efficiency, and reliability.
- Determine the most likely effective solution.

### 3. Virtually Apply Solution
- Simulate the application of the most probable solution.
- Use a controlled environment to ensure no direct code changes are made.

### 4. Evaluate Results
- Assess the effectiveness of the virtual application.
- If the problem is resolved, move to testing.
- If not, move to the next ranked solution and repeat the process.

### 5. Testing
- Implement the chosen solution into the code.
- Run comprehensive tests to ensure no new issues arise.

## Example Scenario

To illustrate, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we need to resolve a recurring bug in a web development project.

### 1. Research Potential Solutions
- **Source 1**: Stack Overflow discussion on similar bugs.
- **Source 2**: GitHub repository with related issues.
- **Source 3**: Academic paper on debugging techniques.
- **Source 4**: Expert blog post on common pitfalls.

### 2. Rank Solutions
- **Solution 1**: Fix suggested in Stack Overflow (Most Likely)
- **Solution 2**: Fix from GitHub issue tracker (Second Most Likely)
- **Solution 3**: Technique from academic paper (Third Most Likely)

### 3. Virtually Apply Solution
- Run a simulation using a controlled environment to apply the fix from Stack Overflow.

### 4. Evaluate Results
- If the bug is resolved, move to testing.
- If not, try the next solution.

### 5. Testing
- Implement the fix from Stack Overflow.
- Run unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing to ensure stability.

## Next Steps
Once the strategy is confirmed, the user can switch to the `code` mode for implementation.
