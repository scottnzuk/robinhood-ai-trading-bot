# Next Core AI Trading Framework Tasks

## 1. Adaptive Learning Module (`adaptive_learning.py`)

- **Regime Detection:**  
  Implement logic to classify current market regime (bull, bear, sideways, volatile).  
  Use statistical features, clustering, or ML classifiers.

- **Online Learning Update:**  
  Enable incremental model updates with new data, avoiding full retraining.  
  Use partial_fit or streaming methods.

- **Meta-Optimization:**  
  Implement hyperparameter tuning during training, possibly with Bayesian optimization or evolutionary strategies.

- **Adversarial Data Generation & Training:**  
  Generate adversarial examples to improve model robustness.  
  Integrate into training loop.

- **Model Save/Load/Selection:**  
  Save best models, load them, and select appropriate model at runtime.

## 2. Risk Manager Module (`risk_manager.py`)

- **Kelly Sizing with Adjustments:**  
  Calculate optimal position sizing, adjusted for risk preferences.

- **ATR + RL-based Stop Optimization:**  
  Use Average True Range and reinforcement learning to optimize stop losses and take profits.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:**  
  Simulate portfolio returns under various scenarios.

- **CVaR Calculation:**  
  Compute Conditional Value at Risk for tail risk management.

- **Portfolio Risk Aggregation:**  
  Aggregate individual asset risks into portfolio-level metrics.

## 3. Execution Engine Module (`execution_engine.py`)

- **Kelly Sizing + Liquidity Adjustment:**  
  Adjust position sizing based on market liquidity.

- **Adaptive Order Type Selection:**  
  Choose between limit, market, or other order types dynamically.

- **Order Placement via API:**  
  Integrate with broker APIs to place orders reliably.

## Next Steps

- **Switch to Architect mode** to expand detailed design for these implementations.  
- **Then recursively proceed to Code mode** for implementation.
