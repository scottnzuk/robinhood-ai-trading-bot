# Adaptive Learning Module - Augmentation Plan

## Objective
Enhance existing adaptive learning components to support modular, self-improving AI trading with seamless integration.

---

## Enhancements

### 1. OnlineLearner
- **Add `connect_feature_pipeline(pipeline)`**: attach feature engineering pipeline
- **Add `connect_signal_generator(generator)`**: attach signal generator
- **Add `evaluate_performance(X_val, y_val, metric_fn)`**: monitor performance
- **Add `_trigger_self_improvement()`**: retrain or tune if performance drops
- **Maintain `performance_history`**: track recent scores

### 2. MetaOptimizer
- **Expose `update_hyperparams(params)`**: update model parameters dynamically
- **Integrate with OnlineLearner**: trigger hyperparam search if needed

### 3. Integration Flow
- **Feature pipeline** → **MarketRegimeDetector** → **OnlineLearner**  
- **OnlineLearner** → **MetaOptimizer** (if performance drops)  
- **AdversarialTrainer** used periodically for robustness  
- **ModelManager** saves best models periodically or on improvement

## Implementation Steps
1. Extend `OnlineLearner` with integration methods and performance monitoring
2. Extend `MetaOptimizer` with dynamic update capability
3. Connect components via new methods
4. Update documentation and Memory Bank
5. Prepare hooks for integration with risk management, execution, and backtesting

## Notes
- Avoid overwriting existing logic; extend with minimal disruption
- Use placeholders for complex meta-learning, to be expanded iteratively
- Log all key decisions and integration points
