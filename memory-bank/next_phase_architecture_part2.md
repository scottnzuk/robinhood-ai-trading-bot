## 2. Module Responsibilities

### RL Agents (`src/ai_trading_framework/rl_agents/`)
- PPO, A3C implementations
- Expose trainable functions for Ray Tune

### Ray Tune Integration (`src/ai_trading_framework/trainers/`)
- Wrap RL agents as Ray Tune trainables
- Define hyperparameter search spaces
- Manage distributed tuning jobs
- Log metrics and checkpoints

### Backtesting (`src/ai_trading_framework/backtesting.py`)
- Standard API to evaluate trained policies
- Batch processing and metrics calculation
- Result storage and visualization

### Deployment (`docker-compose.yml`, CI configs)
- Containerize modules
- Automate build/test/deploy via GitHub Actions

### Security Automation (`scripts/`, CI)
- Monitor upstream patches
- Automate patch application/testing
- Document in Memory Bank
