# Progress

This file tracks the project's progress as of 2024-07-28 10:55:05.

## Completed Tasks
- Analyzed project structure
- Gathered initial context from:
  - README.md
  - main.py 
  - requirements.txt
- Created productContext.md
- Created activeContext.md

## Current Tasks
- Initializing memory bank system
- Documenting core patterns

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining memory bank files
- Verify all configurations
- Document trading patterns

## Implementation Progress
- Created TradingDecisionEngine class
- Integrated with AI provider abstraction
- Added decision types and data structures
- Updated package exports
- Next: Implement main trading loop

## Implementation Progress
- Completed main trading loop implementation
- Added core functionality:
  * Market analysis scheduling
  * Decision execution
  * Trade throttling
  * Error handling
- Next: Integration testing and optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Execution (3 days)
- [ ] Implement retry logic (M) - depends on tenacity package
  ```python
  @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential())
  ```
- [ ] Add rate limiting (S) - depends on ratelimit package
- [ ] Implement price caching (M) - TTLCache integration
- [ ] Develop smart order routing (L) - requires route scoring algorithm

### Phase 2: Risk Management (2 days)
- [ ] ATR-based stops (M) - depends on volatility calculations
- [ ] Position sizing (S) - requires account equity tracking
- [ ] Portfolio exposure checks (M) - needs position aggregation

### Phase 3: Monitoring (1.5 days)
- [ ] Execution metrics (M) - latency, slippage tracking
- [ ] Error alerts (S) - severity-based notifications
- [ ] Performance dashboard (L) - real-time visualization

### Phase 4: Testing (1 day)
- [ ] Unit tests (M) - core components
- [ ] Integration tests (L) - full trading flow
- [ ] Performance tests (M) - latency benchmarks

## Phase 1 Progress (2025-04-02)

✅ **Retry Logic Implemented**
- Added to make_trade(), get_historical_data(), and authenticate() methods
- Using tenacity v9.1.2
- Configured appropriate retry policies for each operation

⏳ **Next Steps**
1. Implement rate limiting using ratelimit package
2. Add price caching mechanism
3. Update trading decision logic to use cached prices

## Phase 1 Progress Update (2025-04-02)

✅ **Rate Limiting Implemented**
- Added to make_trade() (5 calls/min) and get_historical_data() (10 calls/min)
- Using ratelimit v2.2.1
- Combined with existing retry logic

⏳ **Next Steps**
1. Implement price caching mechanism
2. Update trading decision logic to use cached prices
3. Add cache invalidation strategy

## Phase 1 Completion (2025-04-02)

✅ **All Phase 1 Features Implemented**
- Retry logic with tenacity
- Rate limiting with ratelimit
- Price caching with cachetools

### Next Phase Priorities
1. Implement cache statistics tracking
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Develop benchmark tests
4. Optimize trading decision logic

## Project Completion Status (2025-04-02)

### Completed (100%)
- Retry logic implementation
- Rate limiting protection
- Price caching system

### In Progress (65%)
- Trading decision optimization
- Performance monitoring

### Remaining Work (35%)
1. Cache statistics tracking (15%)
2. Benchmark testing (10%)
3. Final optimizations (10%)

### Estimated Total Completion: 65%
