## Completed Phases

- ✅ **Async orchestration with fallback chains**
- ✅ **Real MCP module integration**
- ✅ **RAG retrieval, caching, and prompt injection**
- ✅ **Multi-agent debate coordination with consensus voting**
- ✅ **Full integration of RAG + debate + fallback orchestration**
- ✅ **Rewrote `src/mcp_gateway.py` with all endpoints**
- ✅ **Saved architecture plans and integration details in Memory Bank**

---

## Current Phase: Finalization

### Testing & Validation
- Develop unit and integration tests
- Simulate failures and fallback chains
- Benchmark performance
- Acceptance criteria: >90% success, graceful degradation

### Documentation
- Update Memory Bank with:
  - Final architecture diagrams
  - API usage
  - Testing results
  - Deployment instructions

### Deployment
- Containerize gateway
- Prepare configs and CI/CD
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring setup

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests
- [ ] Validate with real MCP modules
- [ ] Finalize documentation updates
- [ ] Prepare deployment artifacts
- [ ] Conduct final review and handoff

[2025-04-06 04:10:07] - Completed implementation of A3C agent with Ray Tune integration in src/ai_trading_framework/rl_agents/a3c.py.
[2025-04-06 04:13:51] - Completed implementation of backtesting framework with data fetchers, simulation engine, RL agent wrapper, and metrics module in src/ai_trading_framework/backtesting.py.
[2025-04-06 07:27:00] - Completed autonomous modular refactoring: merged tests, added CI, recovered from accidental deletions.
[2025-04-06 12:10:11] - Implemented configurable latency/slippage modeling framework (`latency_slippage_models.py`).
[2025-04-06 12:10:11] - Implemented execution metrics logger with real-time aggregation (`execution_metrics_logger.py`).
[2025-04-06 12:10:11] - Implemented scenario injector with deterministic replay (`scenario_injector.py`).


## 2025-04-06 16:44 - Decorator Integration Progress
- Upgraded `safe_mps_op` with async support.
- Applied decorators to training and trading loops.
- Improved resilience against GPU errors and timeouts.
- Next: Decorate RL agent functions, enhance logging, add tests.
[2025-04-06 12:10:11] - Saved architecture and implementation plans for latency/slippage, metrics, scenarios, and feedback API.
