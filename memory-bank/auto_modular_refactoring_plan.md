# Autonomous Modular Refactoring Progress Analysis & Processing Plan
*Date: 2025-04-06 07:23 (London)*

---

## Objective
Fully analyze and process the current modular refactoring progress file, optimize workflow, and autonomously manage subtasks using Roo Code capabilities.

---

## Step 1: Read and Analyze

- Read `memory-bank/modular_refactoring_progress.md`.
- Extract:
  - Completed refactoring steps.
  - Pending tasks.
  - Identified blockers.
  - Architectural notes.
  - Areas needing updates or clarification.

---

## Step 2: Identify Gaps & Improvements

- Detect outdated or incomplete sections.
- Propose updates or new subtasks.
- Suggest architectural improvements.
- Highlight dependencies or risks.

---

## Step 3: Subtask Creation & Mode Switching

- **Architect Mode:**
  - Expand/refine the plan.
  - Define architecture changes.
  - Update Memory Bank design docs if needed.
- **Code Mode:**
  - Implement code changes.
  - Update progress files.
  - Refactor modules.
- **Test Mode:**
  - Generate/refine tests for refactored modules.
  - Validate correctness.
- **Debug Mode:**
  - Troubleshoot issues found during testing or integration.
- **Ask Mode:**
  - Document explanations.
  - Update documentation.

---

## Step 4: Update Memory Bank

- Log decisions (`decisionLog.md`).
- Update `activeContext.md` with current focus.
- Append progress to `progress.md`.
- Revise architectural/system pattern docs if needed.

---

## Step 5: Loop

- Repeat steps 1-4 until the modular refactoring progress is fully up-to-date and optimized.

## Next Action

- **Read `memory-bank/modular_refactoring_progress.md` content.**
