## Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Sources:** News APIs, Twitter, RSS, financial reports, exchange feeds.
- **Tech:** Async HTTP clients, WebSockets, message queues.
- **Output:** Raw text + market data streams.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Use Trading-Hero-LLM to classify incoming texts.
- Tag data with sentiment labels and confidence scores.
- Store in time-series DB or streaming pipeline.

### 3. Market Data Processing
- Compute technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD, etc.).
- Extract fundamental features (earnings, ratios).
- Normalize and align with sentiment data.

### 4. Signal Generation
- Combine sentiment, technical, and fundamental signals.
- Use ensemble models or rule-based logic.
- Output buy/sell/hold signals with confidence.

### 5. Decision Engine
- Incorporate portfolio constraints.
- Adjust position sizing dynamically.
- Apply risk management overlays.

### 6. Risk Management
- Enforce stop-loss, take-profit, max drawdown.
- Monitor exposure and diversification.
- Approve or reject trade signals.

### 7. Trade Execution
- Connect to broker APIs (Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, etc.).
- Place, modify, cancel orders.
- Monitor fills, slippage, latency.

### 8. Trade Logging
- Record all signals, orders, fills, market context.
- Store for audit and analysis.

### 9. Feedback Loop
- Analyze trade outcomes.
- Retrain sentiment and signal models.
- Refine strategies continuously.
