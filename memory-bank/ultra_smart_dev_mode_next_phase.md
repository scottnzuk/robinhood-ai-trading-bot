## 1. Feature Engineering Branch

- Multi-timeframe normalization and alignment  
- Technical indicator extraction (EMA, RSI, Bollinger, VWAP, MACD, Stochastic)  
- Order book feature engineering (depth, imbalance, spread)  
- Sentiment and event embeddings (NLP models)  
- Blockchain analytics integration  
- Adaptive feature selection and pruning  
- **Output:** Clean, multi-modal tensors for model input

---

## 2. Model Training Branch

- Hybrid LSTM + Transformer architecture  
- Multi-horizon probabilistic forecasting heads  
- Setup classification heads  
- Confidence scoring + entropy filtering  
- Adaptive position sizing logic  
- Custom loss functions (asymmetric Huber, Gaussian NLL)  
- Continual learning hooks  
- Extensive hyperparameter sweeps (Optuna, Ray Tune)  
- **Output:** Optimized model weights, validation metrics

---

## 3. Validation & Testing Branch

- Walk-forward validation  
- Multi-scenario simulations (Monte Carlo, stress events)  
- Multi-regime backtesting  
- Metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, hit rate  
- Robustness and drift detection  
- **Output:** Validation reports, risk metrics

---

## 4. Deployment & Execution Branch

- Rolling inference engine  
- REST/WebSocket integration with exchanges  
- Adaptive risk controls (stop-loss, take-profit, exposure throttling)  
- Ultra-low latency optimization (TorchScript, ONNX)  
- Real-time monitoring and failover  
- **Output:** Live trading system

---

## 5. Documentation Layer (Continuous)

- `architecture.md`: Updated diagrams, data flows  
- `changelog.md`: Actions, rationale, iterations  
- `usage.md`: Setup, run, configure, deploy  
- `issues.md`: Challenges, edge cases  
- `refactor_notes.md`: Optimization logs

---

## 6. Next Step

- Switch to **Code mode**  
- Implement **feature engineering branch**  
- Auto-switch to subsequent phases upon completion
