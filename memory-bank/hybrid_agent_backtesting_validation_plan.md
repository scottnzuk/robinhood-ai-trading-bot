## 1. Advanced Backtesting Framework

- **Walk-Forward Validation:**
  - Rolling windows, no lookahead bias
  - Refit or update model at each step
- **Multi-Scenario Simulation:**
  - Monte Carlo paths with bootstrapped returns
  - Stress events (flash crashes, volatility spikes)
  - Regime-switching synthetic data
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios
  - Max drawdown, hit rate, profit factor
  - Tail risk measures (CVaR, expected shortfall)
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Feed scenario results into meta-optimization
  - Adjust continual learning priorities

---

## 2. Multi-Horizon Evaluation

- Forecast accuracy at 10m, 1h, 4h horizons
- Calibration of confidence intervals
- Setup classification precision/recall
- Uncertainty quantification validation

---

## 3. Adaptive Risk Management Feedback

- **Dynamic Position Sizing:**
  - Adjusted based on forecast uncertainty and recent drawdowns
- **Exposure Throttling:**
  - Reduce risk during high entropy or model disagreement
- **Adaptive Stop-Loss/Take-Profit:**
  - Based on volatility regimes and confidence scores
- **Portfolio Aggregation:**
  - Enforce portfolio-level constraints
  - Diversification and correlation control
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Drift detection
  - Trigger retraining or hyperparameter tuning

---

## 4. Documentation & Memory Bank Updates

- Log validation protocols and results
- Archive scenario analyses
- Update risk management strategies
- Document feedback-driven adjustments

---

## 5. Next Step

Switch to **Code mode** to implement backtesting modules, validation routines, and adaptive risk feedback integration.
