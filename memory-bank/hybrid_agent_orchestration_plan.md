## 1. Orchestration Pipeline

- **Startup Sequence:**
  - Initialize data streams and adapters
  - Load latest model weights and hyperparameters
  - Warm up rolling inference buffers
- **Main Loop:**
  - Fetch multimodal data
  - Run hybrid model inference
  - Filter and execute signals
  - Update experience replay buffer
  - Log trades, metrics, and anomalies
- **Asynchronous Tasks:**
  - Monitor open positions and enforce risk controls
  - Run continual learning updates periodically
  - Trigger meta-optimization in background
  - Perform drift detection and alerting

---

## 2. Monitoring & Logging

- **Metrics:**
  - Latency, throughput, error rates
  - Forecast accuracy, calibration
  - PnL, drawdown, Sharpe/Sortino
- **Event Logging:**
  - Trades, order statuses
  - Model updates and hyperparameter changes
  - Risk events and anomalies
- **Visualization:**
  - Real-time dashboards (Grafana, Kibana)
  - Historical analysis

---

## 3. Autonomous Self-Improvement Cycle

- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - Performance degradation
  - Data drift or regime change
  - Risk threshold breaches
- **Actions:**
  - Recalibrate uncertainty and thresholds
  - Update model weights via online learning
  - Launch meta-optimization sweeps
  - Generate synthetic/adversarial data for robustness
- **Validation:**
  - Backtest updated models
  - Run scenario simulations
  - Approve or rollback updates based on metrics
- **Documentation:**
  - Log all changes in Memory Bank
  - Archive validation results

---

## 4. Memory Bank & Documentation

- Update decision logs and architecture diagrams
- Track model versions, hyperparameters, and retraining events
- Archive performance metrics and validation outcomes
- Document risk adjustments and anomalies

---

## 5. Next Step

Switch to **Code mode** to implement orchestration scripts, monitoring hooks, and autonomous self-improvement triggers.
