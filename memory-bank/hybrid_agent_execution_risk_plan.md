*Date: 2025-04-06 07:35 (London)*

---

## 1. Exchange Integration

- **Data Ingestion:**
  - WebSocket streams for live order book, trades, and tick data
  - REST API polling fallback
  - Synchronize with multimodal feature pipeline
- **Order Execution:**
  - REST endpoints for order placement, modification, cancellation
  - Support for market, limit, iceberg, TWAP/VWAP orders
  - Latency monitoring and failover logic
- **Supported Exchanges:**
  - Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc.
  - Modular adapters for new exchanges

---

## 2. Real-Time Execution Pipeline

- **Rolling Inference:**
  - Update predictions every n candles or ticks
  - Maintain context windows for LSTM/Transformer
- **Signal Filtering:**
  - Thresholds on confidence and uncertainty
  - Entropy-based filtering to avoid low-quality trades
- **Order Management:**
  - Dynamic sizing based on confidence, volatility, drawdown
  - Adaptive order types based on liquidity and latency
  - Real-time monitoring of fills and slippage
- **Latency Optimization:**
  - Async event loops
  - TorchScript/ONNX inference
  - Hardware acceleration (GPU, FPGA optional)

---

## 3. Adaptive Risk Control

- **Dynamic Position Sizing:**
  - Kelly Criterion, volatility, recent drawdown
  - Exposure throttling during high uncertainty
- **Stop-Loss & Take-Profit:**
  - Adaptive, based on volatility and confidence
  - RL-optimized trailing stops
- **Portfolio Aggregation:**
  - Enforce portfolio-level risk constraints
  - Diversification and correlation management
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Drift detection
  - Trigger retraining or hyperparameter tuning
  - Log all risk events for auditability

---

## 4. Documentation & Memory Bank Updates

- Log exchange integration details
- Document execution and risk strategies
- Archive latency and risk metrics
- Record adaptive adjustments over time

---

## 5. Next Step

Switch to **Code mode** to implement exchange adapters, real-time execution modules, and adaptive risk controls.
