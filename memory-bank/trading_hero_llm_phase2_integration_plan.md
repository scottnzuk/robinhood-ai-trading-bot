## Components & Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Collect news, reports, social media in real-time.
- Use APIs (e.g., news aggregators, Twitter, RSS feeds).
- Store raw text and metadata.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Use `trading_hero_llm.predict_sentiment()` on ingested text.
- Tag each data point with `neutral`, `positive`, or `negative`.
- Store sentiment labels alongside raw data.

### 3. Market Data Processing
- Ingest price, volume, order book, fundamentals.
- Generate technical indicators and features.

### 4. Signal Generation
- Combine:
  - Sentiment signals (short-term, long-term trends).
  - Technical indicators.
  - Fundamental analysis.
- Use ensemble models or rule-based logic.

### 5. Decision Engine
- Define trading strategies incorporating sentiment.
- Adjust position sizing, entry/exit based on sentiment shifts.
- Apply risk management rules.

### 6. Trade Execution
- Send orders via broker APIs.
- Monitor fills, slippage, latency.

### 7. Feedback Loop
- Log all trades, market conditions, sentiment at decision time.
- Use data for:
  - Model retraining.
  - Strategy refinement.
  - Performance analysis.
