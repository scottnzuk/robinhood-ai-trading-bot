## Phase 1: Audit & Verification

### 1.1 Architecture Review
- Map all modules, classes, functions
- Confirm AI provider abstraction design
- Verify trading loop, decision engine, execution flow
- Check integration points (Robinhood API, AI APIs)
- Review error handling and logging patterns

### 1.2 Dependency & Config Review
- Confirm all dependencies are up-to-date and secure
- Verify `.env` and secret management
- Check AI provider configs
- Confirm trading constraints and demo mode behavior

### 1.3 Code Quality Analysis
- Identify code smells, duplication, anti-patterns
- Check naming conventions and modularity
- Review async usage and concurrency safety

### 1.4 Testing & Coverage
- Inventory existing tests (unit, integration)
- Measure coverage
- Identify gaps and flaky tests

### 1.5 Documentation Validation
- Review Sphinx `.rst` docs
- Check docstrings and inline comments
- Ensure Memory Bank is accurate and cross-referenced

---

## Phase 2: Refactoring Plan

### 2.1 Modularization
- Enforce clear module boundaries
- Decouple AI provider interface
- Isolate trading logic from API calls

### 2.2 Error Handling & Logging
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Improve logging detail and consistency
- Add alerts for critical failures

### 2.3 Optimization
- Optimize trading loop performance
- Improve data processing (parallelism, caching)
- Refactor complex functions into smaller units

### 2.4 Security Enhancements
- Remove any residual hardcoded secrets
- Enforce environment variable usage
- Plan secret management integration

### 2.5 Code Cleanup
- Remove dead code and legacy artifacts
- Fix inconsistent naming
- Add missing docstrings

---

## Phase 3: Documentation & Testing

### 3.1 Architecture Documentation
- Update Mermaid diagrams for current design
- Document module/class/function interfaces

### 3.2 Test Expansion
- Add unit tests for uncovered logic
- Expand integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks
- Automate test execution (CI/CD)

### 3.3 User & Developer Docs
- Update README and contribution guides
- Document setup, usage, and troubleshooting

---

## Phase 4: Implementation & Validation

### 4.1 Iterative Implementation
- Implement improvements in small, testable increments
- Validate each change with tests

### 4.2 Final Validation
- Run full test suite
- Perform manual trading simulations
- Review logs and performance metrics

### 4.3 Documentation Updates
- Update Memory Bank with changes
- Record decisions and progress

---

## Next Actions
- Switch to **Code Mode** to begin implementation.
- Prioritize critical fixes (security, stability).
- Progressively refactor and optimize.
- Maintain detailed documentation throughout.
