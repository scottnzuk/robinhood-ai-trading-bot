# Implementation Plan: Backtesting, Deployment Automation, Security Integration

## 1. Backtesting Workflows

- **Goal:** Enable robust, scriptable, and modular backtesting of trading strategies.
- **Actions:**
  - Review and extend `src/ai_trading_framework/backtesting.py`.
  - Develop CLI interface for running backtests with different configs.
  - Support config files (YAML/JSON).
  - Integrate with data ingestion and model components.
  - Log results and metrics.
  - Provide hooks for visualization/export.

## 2. Deployment Automation (Cross-Platform, No Docker)

- **Goal:** Seamless deployment on Windows, macOS, Linux without Docker.
- **Actions:**
  - Use PyInstaller or similar to create standalone binaries.
  - Write cross-platform build scripts (Python or shell).
  - Automate environment setup (virtualenv, dependency install).
  - Automate packaging and distribution.
  - Optional: Integrate with CI/CD for automated builds.

## 3. Security Patching Integration

- **Goal:** Maintain secure dependencies with minimal manual effort.
- **Actions:**
  - Integrate tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` for vulnerability scanning.
  - Automate scans via scripts or CI.
  - Generate reports on vulnerabilities.
  - Optional: Auto-update dependencies with manual review.

## Next Steps

1. Review existing backtesting code.
2. Implement CLI and config support for backtesting.
3. Develop deployment scripts.
4. Add security scanning scripts.
5. Document all workflows.
6. Integrate into CI/CD if applicable.
