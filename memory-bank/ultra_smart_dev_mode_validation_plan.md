*Date: 2025-04-06 09:14 (London)*

---

## 1. Backtesting Framework

- **Walk-forward validation** with rolling windows  
- **Multi-scenario simulations:**  
  - Monte Carlo paths  
  - Stress events (flash crashes, volatility spikes)  
  - Regime-switching synthetic data  
- **Multi-horizon evaluation:**  
  - Forecast accuracy at 10m, 1h, 4h  
  - Calibration of confidence intervals  
  - Setup classification precision/recall  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios  
  - Max drawdown, hit rate, profit factor  
  - Tail risk measures (CVaR, expected shortfall)

---

## 2. Robustness & Drift Detection

- **Adversarial scenario injection**  
- **Data drift monitoring** (PSI, KS test)  
- **Model calibration checks**  
- **Trigger retraining or hyperparameter tuning** on degradation

---

## 3. Automation & Reporting

- **Auto-run validation suite after each training cycle**  
- **Archive results with timestamps**  
- **Generate dashboards and reports**  
- **Update Memory Bank documentation**

---

## 4. Documentation Layer

- Update `architecture.md` with validation diagrams  
- Log validation runs and rationale in `changelog.md`  
- Archive scenario analyses and calibration results  
- Note robustness adjustments in `refactor_notes.md`

---

## 5. Next Step

- Switch to **Code mode**  
- Implement backtesting, validation, and reporting modules  
- Auto-switch to deployment phase upon completion
