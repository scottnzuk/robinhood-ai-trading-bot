# Crypto Data Acquisition & Analysis Plan

## 1. Data Acquisition Options

- **Binance API:**  
  - Fetch 1-12 months of OHLCV data via REST API.  
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/klines`  
  - Symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, etc.  
  - Intervals: 1m, 5m, 1h, 1d.

- **Kaggle Datasets:**  
  - Download CSV files with historical data.  
  - Example: "Bitcoin Historical Data", "Crypto Market Data".

- **CryptoCompare API:**  
  - Free tier supports daily/hourly/minute data.  
  - Useful for multiple coins.

## 2. Data Storage

- Save raw data as **CSV files** in `data/crypto/` directory.  
- Organize by symbol and timeframe.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

- Convert timestamps to datetime.  
- Calculate features:  
  - Returns, volatility, volume spikes.  
  - Technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD).

---

## 4. Applying AI Trading Framework

- Feed features into **AdaptiveLearning** module.  
- Generate signals and confidence scores.  
- Use **RiskManager** to compute sizing and stops.  
- Simulate order placement with **ExecutionEngine**.  
- Track PnL, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio.

## 5. Insights & Learning Dataset

- Save generated signals, trades, and outcomes.  
- Use as **training data** for refining models.  
- Analyze:  
  - Signal accuracy  
  - Risk-adjusted returns  
  - Failure cases

## 6. Next Steps

- Implement data fetch/load script.  
- Run backtests with framework.  
- Refine models based on results.
