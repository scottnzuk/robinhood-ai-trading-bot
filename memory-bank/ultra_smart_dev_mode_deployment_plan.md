## 1. Rolling Inference Engine

- **Update forecasts every n candles or seconds**  
- **Maintain context windows** for LSTM/Transformer  
- **Filter signals** based on confidence and entropy  
- **Adaptive position sizing**  
- **Trigger stop-loss/take-profit logic**

---

## 2. Exchange Integration

- **REST/WebSocket APIs** for Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.  
- **Order placement, modification, cancellation**  
- **Support market, limit, iceberg, TWAP/VWAP orders**  
- **Latency monitoring and failover**

---

## 3. Adaptive Risk Controls

- **Dynamic sizing based on volatility and drawdown**  
- **Exposure throttling during high uncertainty**  
- **Adaptive stop-loss and take-profit**  
- **Portfolio-level constraints**

---

## 4. Monitoring & Failover

- **Real-time dashboards** (Grafana, Kibana)  
- **Latency, error rates, PnL tracking**  
- **Drift detection and auto-retraining triggers**  
- **Failover to backup models or providers**

---

## 5. Documentation Layer

- Update `architecture.md` with deployment diagrams  
- Log deployment runs and rationale in `changelog.md`  
- Archive risk and latency metrics  
- Note failover adjustments in `refactor_notes.md`

---

## 6. Next Step

- Switch to **Code mode**  
- Implement execution engine, risk controls, and monitoring hooks  
- Auto-switch to Refactor and Test phases upon completion
