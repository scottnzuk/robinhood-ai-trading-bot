# Multi-Stage Signal Generation Engine Architecture

---

## Overview

This document details the design of the **Signal Generation Layer** within the modular AI trading framework. It transforms engineered features into actionable, high-confidence trade signals using a layered, hybrid machine learning approach.

---

## Goals

- **Reduce false positives** through multi-stage filtering.
- **Leverage hybrid ML models** (traditional + deep learning).
- **Enable modular upgrades** and experimentation.
- **Provide explainability** for compliance and debugging.
- **Support online learning** and continual improvement.

## Detailed Layer Breakdown

### Stage 1: Initial Filtering

- **Inputs:** Engineered features (technical, sentiment, on-chain).
- **Models:**
  - Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM).
  - Traditional rule-based filters (e.g., RSI thresholds).
- **Purpose:** Rapidly discard low-probability signals.
- **Outputs:** Candidate signals with initial probability scores.
- **Notes:**
  - Lightweight, fast inference.
  - Can be updated frequently.
  - Feature importance tracked for explainability.

---

### Stage 2: Sequence Refinement

- **Inputs:** Filtered candidates + historical sequences.
- **Models:**
  - LSTM networks capturing temporal dependencies.
  - Transformer models (e.g., Time Series Transformer) for long-range patterns.
- **Features:**
  - Recent price action.
  - Volatility regimes.
  - Sentiment trends.
- **Purpose:** Refine signals based on temporal context.
- **Outputs:** Probability-adjusted signals.
- **Notes:**
  - Trained on rolling windows.
  - Supports online learning.
  - Can incorporate alternative data sequences.

---

### Stage 3: Meta-Ensemble & Confidence Scoring

- **Inputs:** Outputs from Stage 2 + contextual data (market regime, liquidity).
- **Models:**
  - Stacking ensemble (meta-learner combining Stage 2 outputs).
  - Bayesian models for uncertainty estimation.
- **Purpose:** Final decision-making with calibrated confidence.
- **Outputs:** Trade signals (buy/sell/hold) + confidence scores.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensemble improves robustness.
  - Confidence scores used for position sizing and risk management.

---

## Explainability

- **Tools:** SHAP, LIME.
- **Outputs:**
  - Feature importances.
  - Local explanations for each signal.
- **Purpose:** Transparency, debugging, regulatory compliance.

---

## Online Learning & Meta-Optimization

- **Online Learning:**
  - Incremental model updates with new data.
  - Experience replay buffers to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
- **Meta-Optimization:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning (Optuna, Ray Tune).
  - Architecture search via evolutionary algorithms.
- **Purpose:** Continual improvement without full retraining.

---

## Interfaces

- **Inputs:**
  - Feature vectors.
  - Historical sequences.
  - Contextual metadata.
- **Outputs:**
  - Trade signals (buy/sell/hold).
  - Confidence scores.
  - Explanations.
- **APIs:**
  - Python classes/functions.
  - REST endpoints (FastAPI).

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep models.
- Use scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM for traditional models.
- Serve models via TorchServe or FastAPI.
- Modular pipeline: each stage can be swapped independently.
- Log all signals, scores, and explanations for auditability.

---

## Next Steps

- Define data schemas and configs.
- Build baseline models for each stage.
- Integrate with Data Fusion layer.
- Develop training and evaluation pipelines.
- Connect to Execution Optimization layer.
