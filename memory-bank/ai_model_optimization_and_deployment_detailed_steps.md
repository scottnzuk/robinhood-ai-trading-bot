# AI Model Optimization, Validation & Deployment â€” Detailed Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning Integration

### 1.1 Framework Selection
- Use **Optuna** for flexible, lightweight tuning
- Integrate **Ray Tune** for distributed, scalable search (optional, future enhancement)
- Abstract tuning logic to allow easy switch or hybrid use

### 1.2 Integration Points
- Modify `src/ai_trading_framework/trainers/supervised_trainer.py` and `trainers/rl_trainer.py`
- Wrap existing `train()` methods with Optuna study optimization loops
- Define **objective functions** that:
  - Instantiate models with trial params
  - Train and evaluate on validation split
  - Return key metric (e.g., Sharpe, F1, reward)

### 1.3 Parameter Space
- Learning rate, batch size, architecture params
- RL-specific: gamma, entropy coef, clip ratio
- Use Optuna's `suggest_*` API for search space

### 1.4 Automation & Logging
- Enable **early stopping** and **pruning** in Optuna
- Log trials to:
  - Optuna dashboard
  - Memory Bank (configs + results)
  - Git commits with tuning summaries

---

## 2. Backtesting & Validation Workflow

### 2.1 Data Splitting
- Implement **walk-forward validation**
- Cross-validation over:
  - Market regimes
  - Assets
  - Timeframes

### 2.2 Metrics & Visualization
- Compute:
  - Sharpe, Sortino, Drawdown
  - Precision, Recall, F1
  - PnL distribution
- Visualize with:
  - Matplotlib/Plotly dashboards
  - Save plots to `/reports/` directory

### 2.3 Automation
- Create `src/ai_trading_framework/experiments.py`:
  - Run tuning + validation loops
  - Save all configs, results, plots
  - Update Memory Bank with findings

---

## 3. Streamlined Deployment Pipeline

### 3.1 Packaging
- Export best models as:
  - Pickle files
  - TorchScript or ONNX
- Containerize inference API (FastAPI) with Docker

### 3.2 CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions to:
  - Run tests
  - Build Docker images
  - Deploy to staging/prod environments

### 3.3 Monitoring
- Add hooks for:
  - Latency
  - Drift detection
  - Failover triggers

## 4. Documentation & Memory Bank Updates

- Document:
  - Tuning configs & results
  - Validation outcomes
  - Deployment architecture
- Update relevant Memory Bank files **after each milestone**
- Maintain architecture diagrams (draw.io, markdown)

---

## 5. Version Control & Collaboration

- Frequent, atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Branches:
  - `feature/hyperparam-tuning`
  - `feature/backtesting-validation`
  - `feature/deployment-pipeline`
- Pull requests with:
  - Linked plan sections
  - Summaries of changes
  - Test results

---

## Next Steps

1. Architect mode: Review & expand this plan
2. Code mode:  
   - Implement Optuna integration  
   - Develop backtesting workflows  
   - Build deployment pipeline  
3. Test mode: Validate components  
4. Continuous Memory Bank updates and commits
