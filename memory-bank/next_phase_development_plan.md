*Date: 2025-04-06 03:58 (UTC+1)*

## 1. Expand Hyperparameter Optimization with Ray Tune

### 1.1. Identify Key Hyperparameters  
- **PPO:** learning_rate, gamma, clip_param, entropy_coef, value_loss_coef, num_epochs, batch_size  
- **A3C:** learning_rate, gamma, entropy_coef, value_loss_coef, max_grad_norm, update_freq  

### 1.2. Integrate Ray Tune  
- Wrap PPO and A3C training loops as Ray Tune trainables  
- Define search spaces (grid, random, Bayesian)  
- Use distributed Ray cluster for parallel trials  
- Implement checkpointing and early stopping  
- Log metrics to Ray dashboard and local files  

### 1.3. Distributed Tuning Setup  
- Local multi-core and multi-node support  
- Resource allocation (CPU/GPU)  
- Fault tolerance and resume capabilities  

---

## 2. Robust End-to-End Backtesting Workflows

### 2.1. Standardize Backtesting Interface  
- Define API to input trained policies  
- Historical data ingestion pipeline  
- Simulated environment with market constraints  

### 2.2. Automation  
- Batch backtesting with multiple agents/params  
- Metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, win rate, turnover  
- Result storage and visualization (plots, reports)  

---

## 3. Deployment Pipeline Automation

### 3.1. Containerization  
- Dockerize training, tuning, inference, and backtesting modules  
- Version control of images  

### 3.2. CI/CD Integration  
- GitHub Actions workflows:  
  - Linting, unit tests, integration tests  
  - Build and push Docker images  
  - Trigger deployments on staging/prod  

### 3.3. Continuous Delivery  
- Automated rollout with rollback support  
- Canary/batch deployment options  

---

## 4. Security Patch Integration

### 4.1. Patch Monitoring  
- Automate fetching security-related PRs from GitHub  

### 4.2. Patch Application  
- Merge/apply patches in isolated branches  
- Run regression and security tests  

### 4.3. Verification  
- Approve and merge post-validation  
- Document patch details in Memory Bank  

---

## 5. Memory Bank Maintenance

- Timestamped documentation of:  
  - Design decisions  
  - Progress updates  
  - Architectural changes  
  - Patch integrations  
- Frequent commits after major/minor steps  

---

## 6. Iterative Cycle

- After each phase:  
  - Update Memory Bank  
  - Review/plan next steps  
  - Switch between Architect and Code modes accordingly  

---

## Initial Next Steps:

1. **Architect Mode:** Expand this plan into detailed architecture diagrams and module specifications.  
2. **Code Mode:** Implement Ray Tune integration for PPO and A3C agents.  
3. **Test Mode:** Develop test cases for tuning and backtesting workflows.  
4. **Debug Mode:** Monitor and fix issues during integration.
