## 1. Continual Learning Integration

- **Experience Replay:**
  - Maintain buffer of recent multimodal sequences + outcomes
  - Prioritize diverse, regime-shifting samples
- **Online Gradient Updates:**
  - Periodically fine-tune on replay buffer
  - Use small learning rates to avoid forgetting
  - Trigger updates on regime change detection
- **Meta-Optimization:**
  - Adaptive hyperparameter tuning during operation
  - Architecture search in background (evolutionary, Bayesian)
- **Robustness Enhancements:**
  - Inject adversarial/synthetic data into replay
  - Penalize overconfident errors

---

## 2. Multi-Horizon Probabilistic Loss Functions

- **Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL):**
  - For each horizon, predict mean + variance
  - Loss:  
    `L_NLL = 0.5 * log_var + 0.5 * ((target - mean)^2 / exp(log_var))`
- **Asymmetric Huber Loss:**
  - Penalize false positives more heavily
  - Focus on precision during volatile regimes
- **Auxiliary Losses:**
  - Market regime classification (cross-entropy)
  - Setup detection (breakout, mean reversion)
- **Uncertainty Calibration:**
  - Temperature scaling on logits
  - Quantile regression options for VaR estimation
- **Total Loss:**
  - Weighted sum of all components
  - Dynamic weights adjusted via meta-learning

---

## 3. Ultra-Low Latency Deployment

- **Model Export:**
  - TorchScript or ONNX for optimized inference
  - Quantization-aware training to reduce size
- **Inference Pipeline:**
  - Async, batched inference every n candles
  - Maintain rolling context windows
- **Hardware Optimization:**
  - GPU acceleration with TensorRT
  - CPU fallback with MKL/OpenVINO
- **Exchange Integration:**
  - WebSocket for live data
  - REST for order execution
  - Sub-second latency targets
- **Risk Controls:**
  - Exposure throttling during high uncertainty
  - Adaptive stop-loss/take-profit triggers
- **Monitoring:**
  - Latency, throughput, error rates
  - Drift detection and auto-retraining triggers

---

## 4. Documentation & Memory Bank Updates

- Log all design choices in `decisionLog.md`
- Update architecture diagrams
- Track deployment metrics and retraining events
- Archive validation and calibration results

---

## 5. Next Step

Switch to **Code mode** to implement continual learning hooks, loss functions, and deployment scaffolding.
