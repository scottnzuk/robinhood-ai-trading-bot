# AI Model Optimization, Validation, and Deployment Plan

---

## 1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

- Use frameworks like **Optuna** or **Ray Tune**
- Tune:
  - Learning rates, batch sizes
  - Network depths, widths
  - Dropout rates, activation functions
  - RL-specific params (discount factor, entropy coef)
- Automate tuning with **early stopping** and **parallel trials**
- Log all results and insights to Memory Bank

---

## 2. **Backtesting & Validation Workflows**

- Historical simulation with **walk-forward validation**
- Metrics:
  - Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown
  - Precision, recall, F1 for classification
  - PnL distribution, turnover, slippage
- Cross-validation across:
  - Market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
  - Asset classes
  - Timeframes
- Visualize results with dashboards
- Document findings and model selection rationale

---

## 3. **Integration for Live Deployment**

- Wrap models in **inference APIs** (FastAPI, gRPC)
- Implement **model versioning** and rollback
- Add **latency monitoring** and failover logic
- Integrate with **execution engine** and **risk manager**
- Automate **continuous retraining** and **regime adaptation**
- Maintain detailed deployment logs and Memory Bank updates

---

## 4. **Testing & Documentation**

- Unit + integration tests for tuning, validation, deployment code
- Reproducibility scripts
- Update Memory Bank with:
  - Tuning configs and results
  - Validation findings
  - Deployment architecture and status
  - Open questions and next steps
