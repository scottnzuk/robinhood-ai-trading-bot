# Next Autonomous Enhancements Implementation Plan
*Date: 2025-04-06*

## 1. Risk Management Integration

### Goals:
- Dynamically size positions based on model confidence (e.g., prediction probability or uncertainty).
- Adaptive stop-loss and take-profit levels responsive to confidence and market conditions.

### Approach:
- **Extend `risk_manager.py`:**
  - Add method `calculate_position_size(confidence_score, account_balance, risk_tolerance)`:
    - Larger size for high confidence, smaller for low.
    - Incorporate Kelly criterion or fractional sizing.
  - Add method `determine_adaptive_stops(entry_price, confidence_score, market_volatility)`:
    - Wider stops for high confidence, tighter for low.
    - Adjust take-profit similarly.
- **Integration:**
  - Modify trade signal consumer to request position size and stops from risk manager.
  - Log risk parameters for traceability.

## 2. Execution Simulation and Feedback

### Goals:
- Simulate realistic order execution with slippage and latency.
- Feed execution quality metrics back into adaptive learner to improve decision-making.

### Approach:
- **Extend `execution_engine.py`:**
  - Add `simulate_execution(order, market_state)`:
    - Introduce configurable latency (randomized within bounds).
    - Apply slippage model (fixed %, random, or based on volume).
    - Return executed price, fill status, latency.
  - Add `record_execution_feedback(trade_id, execution_metrics)`:
    - Metrics: slippage amount, latency, fill ratio.
    - Store in execution history.
- **Integration:**
  - Adaptive learner ingests execution feedback to adjust future confidence scores or model weights.

## 3. Backtesting with Scenario Injection

### Goals:
- Run multi-period, multi-asset simulations.
- Inject market shocks, regime shifts, anomalies.
- Track detailed performance metrics across scenarios.

### Approach:
- **Extend `backtesting.py`:**
  - Support multi-asset portfolios and rolling time windows.
  - Add scenario generator module:
    - Shock events (e.g., sudden price drops).
    - Volatility regime changes.
    - Data anomalies (missing data, spikes).
  - Track per-scenario metrics: drawdown, Sharpe, win rate, execution quality.
- **Integration:**
  - Enable scenario configs via CLI or config file.
  - Log scenario parameters and results for reproducibility.

## 4. Memory Bank & Documentation Updates

### Goals:
- Maintain traceability of architecture changes and decisions.
- Update `.md` files in `memory-bank/` after each major step.

### Approach:
- Log:
  - Design decisions in `decisionLog.md`.
  - Progress updates in `progress.md`.
  - Architecture changes in relevant architecture docs.
- Automate or script parts of this if possible.
