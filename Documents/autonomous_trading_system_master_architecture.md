# Autonomous Crypto Trading System - Master Architecture

*Generated 2025-04-06 19:34 UTC+1*

## üöÄ Core Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Isolated, swappable components (not docker-dependent).
- **Extensibility:** Plugin system for data sources, strategies, models (YAML/JSON configs).
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breakers, dead man‚Äôs switch, graceful degradation.
- **Performance:** Sub-10ms latency for HFT, async swing processing.
- **Transparency:** Real-time dashboards (Grafana), audit logs (S3/Elastic).
- **Continuous Learning:** Auto-backtesting on new data regimes.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Rate limits, wash trade detection.

## üèó Architecture Layers & Components

### 1. Data Fabric

- **Multi-Exchange Ingestion:** Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, CoinGecko, TradingView.
- **Real-Time + Historical:** WebSocket prioritized (<50ms latency), REST fallback.
- **Geodistributed Nodes:** AWS Tokyo, Frankfurt, NYC.
- **Data Integrity Layer:**
  - **Triangulation Engine:** Cross-validate ‚â•3 exchanges.
  - **Outlier Auto-Correction:** Interpolate corrupted/missing candles.
  - **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Alerts.**
- **Latency Optimizer:** Drop REST if WebSocket lags.
- **Specialized Storage:**
  - Redis Streams (order book snapshots).
  - Parquet + DuckDB (columnar queries).
- **Validation Rules:**
  - Price discrepancy >0.2% triggers arbitrage alert.
  - Z-score filtering, volume spike verification.
  - Timestamp sync to Binance.

### 2. Analytics & Intelligence

- **Multi-Resolution Ensemble:**
  - Combine 1s (HFT), 1m (momentum), 1h (trend) via weighted voting.
- **Market Regime Detector:**
  - Classify Bull/Bear/Range/Volatile using crypto VIX.
- **Liquidity Forecaster:**
  - Predict slippage via order book decay modeling.
- **Confidence Scoring:**

| Factor                 | Weight | Example                                  |
|------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Multi-TF Alignment     | 30%    | 1s + 1h EMA agree                       |
| Volume Confirmation    | 25%    | Breakout with 2x avg volume             |
| Whale Activity         | 20%    | OI change + large taker buys            |
| Macro Correlation      | 15%    | BTC dominance rising                    |
| Risk-Adjusted Reward   | 10%    | Sharpe >2 in backtests                  |

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - EMAs, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, VWAP, TWAP.
  - Delta Pressure, Liquidity Zones, Whale Alerts.
  - Candle patterns, fractals, auto-labeling.
- **Model Training & Deployment:**
  - Walk-forward validation.
  - Continuous monitoring & retraining.

### 3. Strategy & Execution

- **Dynamic Strategy Allocation:**
  - HFT: >5 signals/min, 0.1% sizing.
  - Swing: <1 signal/hour, 2% sizing.
- **Anti-Gaming Measures:**
  - Iceberg orders, randomized delays.
  - Exchange-specific tactics (post-only, TWAP).
- **Real-Time Risk Engine:**
  - Max drawdown halt (>5% daily).
  - Blacklist illiquid/high-spread symbols.
- **Order Management:**
  - Broker/exchange API abstraction.
  - Simulation, paper, live modes.
  - Execution monitoring.

---

### 4. Orchestration & Monitoring

- **Priority Scheduling:**
  - HFT tasks: CPU-pinned, real-time threads.
  - Backtests: batch jobs.
- **Self-Healing Pipeline:**
  - Auto-retry, exponential backoff.
  - Data replay from backup.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):**
  - Telegram alerts.
  - Emergency override ("FLAT ALL").
- **Dashboards & Logs:**
  - Grafana, Elastic, S3.
  - Daily reports: signals, anomalies, model updates.
