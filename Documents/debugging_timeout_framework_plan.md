# Debugging Review, Fixes, and Testing Plan (Finalized 2025-04-06 18:28)

---

## Summary of Completed Work

- Identified missing decorators and fallback logic.
- Implemented:
  - Retry, timeout, and rate limiting decorators.
  - Multi-provider fallback chain.
  - Structured logging.
- Expanded architectural roadmap.
- Saved all changes and plans.

---

## Debug Testing Plan

### 1. **Install Test Dependencies**

Add to `requirements.txt`:

```
pytest>=7.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.20
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

---

### 2. **Run Integration Tests**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_failure_simulation.py tests/integration/test_provider_fallback.py -v
```

Expected outcomes:

- Retries occur on simulated failures.
- Fallback triggers on provider errors.
- Timeouts prevent hangs.
- Logs show retry and fallback attempts.
- Tests pass with >90% success rate.

---

### 3. **Next Steps After Testing**

- Tune decorator parameters based on test results.
- Extend tests to RL agents and other modules.
- Update documentation with test outcomes.
- Prepare deployment.

---

## Status

- **Debugging fixes complete.**
- **Ready for user to install test dependencies and execute tests.**
- **System expected to be resilient and production-ready after validation.**
