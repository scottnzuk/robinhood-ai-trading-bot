---

## 1. Real-Time Data & Streaming Analytics

- **Upgrade MarketDataFetcher** to support WebSocket streams (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
- **Stream sentiment sources** (Twitter, Reddit, news feeds).
- **Incremental feature updates** on new data ticks.
- **Sliding window analytics** for near real-time trend detection.
- **Event-driven triggers** for alerts and trade signals.

---

## 2. Backtesting Framework

- **Historical data replay** to simulate past market conditions.
- **Plug-in existing analytics pipeline** for scoring during replay.
- **Evaluate strategy performance:** Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate.
- **Parameter optimization** via grid/random search.
- **Integration with `backtesting.py` or custom engine.**

---

## 3. Automated Trade Execution

- **Broker API integration:** Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, etc.
- **Order management:** market, limit, stop-loss.
- **Risk controls:** position sizing, max loss, exposure limits.
- **Execution monitoring:** slippage, latency, fill status.
- **Simulation mode** before live deployment.

---

## 4. Continuous Learning & Model Retraining

- **Collect new labeled data** (price + sentiment + outcomes).
- **Scheduled retraining** of sentiment and analytics models.
- **Model versioning** and rollback.
- **Online learning** for incremental updates.
- **Performance monitoring** of deployed models.

---

## 5. UI / Dashboard

- **Live visualization** of market data, sentiment, analytics.
- **Historical charts** with overlays of signals and trades.
- **Configurable alerts** and notifications.
- **Backtest results visualization.**
- **User controls** for strategy parameters.

---

## 6. Infrastructure, Monitoring & Scalability

- **Containerization:** Docker for deployment.
- **Task orchestration:** Celery, Ray, or Airflow.
- **Logging & monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Error handling:** retries, alerts on failures.
- **Scalability:** multi-core, multi-node support.

---

## 7. Documentation & Testing

- **API documentation** (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- **Unit & integration tests** for all modules.
- **Performance benchmarks.**
- **User guides** for configuration and usage.

---

## 8. Open Questions

- Preferred broker/exchange APIs?
- Real-time data latency requirements?
- Frequency of retraining?
- Deployment environment (cloud, on-prem)?
- User roles and access controls?

---

## 9. Immediate Next Steps

- Prototype WebSocket streaming ingestion.
- Design backtesting API and data flow.
- Define broker integration interface.
- Plan UI/dashboard wireframes.
- Expand test coverage.
