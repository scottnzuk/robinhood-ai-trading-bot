- Immune to memory leaks
- Impervious to faulty logic
- Relentlessly precise
- Fully autonomous, 24/7, zero intervention
- Modular, scalable, and unstoppable

## ‚úÖ Master Task Checklist

### System Architecture
- [x] Modular, event-driven core (data, features, signals, execution, logging)
- [x] Real-time async orchestration with bulletproof exception handling
- [x] Self-healing restart protocols, zero downtime failover
- [x] Horizontal scalability, minimal latency, deterministic performance

### Data Acquisition
- [x] Multi-resolution OHLCV (1s, 1m, 5m, 1h, 1d) from redundant sources
- [x] Continuous integrity checks, timestamp sync, conflict resolution
- [x] Anomaly flagging, logging, categorization

### Feature Engineering
- [x] Enriched indicators: EMA, RSI, VWAP, MACD, Bollinger, candle patterns
- [x] Efficient rolling windows, caching, redundant calc elimination
- [x] Normalized, unit-consistent datasets, compressed storage, indexing

### Data Management
- [x] Compressed, indexed stores with rolling retention, deduplication, versioning
- [x] Automated lifecycle management for rapid access, minimal footprint

### Strategy Development
- [x] Diverse strategies: momentum, reversal, breakout, pattern-based
- [x] Comprehensive multi-timeframe backtesting
- [x] Multi-resolution scoring: alignment, volume, volatility
- [x] Noise suppression: adaptive thresholds, cooldowns, anomaly filters
- [x] Rigorous risk controls: drawdown, exposure, stop-loss, take-profit
- [x] Deterministic, async-safe order handlers with resilient fallback
- [x] System health monitoring, auto-throttle/restart on breach
- [x] Granular metrics logging (latency, memory, accuracy) in Markdown/JSON
- [x] Memory pooling, leak detection, garbage tuning, bottleneck elimination

### Autonomous Operation
- [x] Live Markdown journal: task status, model iterations, anomalies, lessons
- [x] Seamless role transitions: Architect, Developer, Debugger, Maintainer
- [x] Continuous code refinement, re-benchmarking, live adaptation
- [x] Zero tolerance for failure, shortcuts, or inefficiency
