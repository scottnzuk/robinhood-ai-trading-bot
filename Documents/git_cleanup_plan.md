# Git Repository Cleanup Plan

**Date:** 2025-04-06  
**Location:** `/Users/byteme/robinhood-ai-trading-bot`  
**Purpose:** Reduce active changes to restore optimal Git performance and full feature availability.

---

## Step 1: Assess Current Status

- Run `git status` to list:
  - Unstaged changes
  - Staged but uncommitted changes
  - Untracked files

## Step 2: Decide on Actions

- **Stage** all modified and new files that are ready.
- **Commit** staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **Stash** any work-in-progress or partial changes not ready to commit.
- Optionally, **discard** unwanted changes.

## Step 3: Execute Cleanup

- `git add -A` (stage all changes)
- `git commit -m "WIP: Save current progress before major update"` (commit staged changes)
- If needed, `git stash push -m "WIP: Partial changes"` (stash remaining work)

## Step 4: Verify

- Run `git status` again to confirm a clean state.
- Ensure no active changes remain unless intentionally left.

## Step 5: Proceed with Development

- With a clean working directory, resume development tasks.
- Pass control to Architect mode for next-step planning.

## Notes

- Review staged changes before committing if necessary.
- Use `git stash pop` later to restore stashed work.
- This plan aims to minimize disruption and data loss.
