# Ultralytics YOLO - Hugging Face Integration Test Results

## Summary
- The environment **successfully connected** to Hugging Face Hub.
- The test script **downloaded the full `bert-base-uncased` model files**.
- An internal error (`init_empty_weights` not defined) occurred **after download**, which is unrelated to connectivity.

## Conclusion
- **Hugging Face Hub connectivity is functional.**
- The error can be fixed with minor adjustments if needed.
- No built-in push/pull integration exists in Ultralytics repo; this would require custom implementation.

## Next Steps
- Architect mode: Plan full integration (uploading YOLO models, versioning, etc.).
- Code mode: Implement integration and fix test script error if necessary.
