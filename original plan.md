# 1. Core Design Principles


**[Note: Will be implemented as native Python packages and modules, no containers required.]**

2. **Extensible plugin system** for data sources, strategies, models (YAML/JSON configs) ‚ùå
**[Note: Achieved via dynamic imports and config files, fully native.]**

3. **Fault tolerance:** Circuit breakers, dead man‚Äôs switch, graceful degradation ‚ùå
**[Note: Implemented in native Python with libraries like `pybreaker` and `tenacity`.]**

4. **Performance:** Sub-10ms latency for HFT, async swing processing ‚ö†Ô∏è
**[Note: Optimized for native Apple Silicon with async I/O and ARM-accelerated libraries.]**

5. **Transparency:** Real-time dashboards (Grafana), audit logs (S3/Elastic) ‚ùå
**[Note: Grafana can run natively or connect to cloud; audit logs stored locally or in cloud storage.]**

6. **Continuous learning:** Auto-backtesting on new data regimes ‚ö†Ô∏è
**[Note: Scheduled via native scripts or cron jobs, no container orchestration.]**

7. **Regulatory compliance:** Rate limits, wash trade detection ‚ùå
**[Note: Enforced via native Python logic and exchange API features.]**

# 2. Data Fabric

8. Multi-exchange ingestion (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bybit, CoinGecko, TradingView) ‚ùå  
9. Real-time + historical data with WebSocket prioritized (<50ms latency), REST fallback ‚ö†Ô∏è  
10. Geodistributed nodes (AWS Tokyo, Frankfurt, NYC) ‚ùå  
11. Data integrity layer with triangulation engine (cross-validate ‚â•3 exchanges) ‚ö†Ô∏è  
12. Outlier auto-correction (interpolate corrupted/missing candles) ‚ùå  
13. Cross-exchange arbitrage alerts ‚ùå  
14. Latency optimizer (drop REST if WebSocket lags) ‚ùå  
15. Specialized storage: Redis Streams (order book snapshots) ‚ùå  
16. Specialized storage: Parquet + DuckDB (columnar queries) ‚ùå  
17. Validation rules: price discrepancy >0.2%, Z-score filtering, volume spike verification, timestamp sync ‚ö†Ô∏è

# 3. Analytics & Intelligence

18. Multi-resolution ensemble combining 1s, 1m, 1h signals via weighted voting ‚ö†Ô∏è  
19. Market regime detector (Bull/Bear/Range/Volatile classification) ‚ùå  
20. Liquidity forecaster (slippage prediction via order book decay) ‚ùå  
21. Confidence scoring with multi-factor weighting (alignment, volume, whale activity, macro, Sharpe) ‚ö†Ô∏è  
22. Feature engineering: EMAs, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, VWAP, TWAP, delta pressure, liquidity zones, whale alerts, candle patterns, fractals, auto-labeling ‚ö†Ô∏è  
23. Model training & deployment: walk-forward validation, continuous monitoring & retraining ‚ö†Ô∏è

# 4. Strategy & Execution

24. Dynamic strategy allocation (HFT vs swing sizing rules) ‚ùå  
25. Anti-gaming measures: iceberg orders, randomized delays ‚ö†Ô∏è  
26. Exchange-specific tactics (post-only, TWAP, rebates) ‚ùå  
27. Real-time risk engine: max drawdown halt, blacklist illiquid symbols ‚ö†Ô∏è  
28. Order management: API abstraction, simulation, paper/live modes, execution monitoring ‚ö†Ô∏è  

---

# 5. Orchestration & Monitoring

29. Priority scheduling: CPU pinning for HFT, batch for backtests ‚ùå  
30. Self-healing pipeline: auto-retry, exponential backoff, data replay from backup ‚ö†Ô∏è  
31. Human-in-the-loop controls: Telegram alerts, emergency override ("FLAT ALL") ‚ùå  
32. Dashboards & logs: Grafana, Elastic, S3, daily reports on signals/anomalies/models ‚ö†Ô∏è

# 6. Deployment, Testing & Documentation

33. Containerization of gateway and services ‚ùå
**[Note: Will be replaced with native Mac M1 Pro deployment scripts and environment setup. No containers involved.]**

34. CI/CD pipeline preparation and configs ‚ùå
**[Note: CI/CD will target native builds, tests, and deployment on Mac hardware.]**

35. Deployment scripts and automation ‚ùå
**[Note: Scripts will automate native environment setup, dependency installation, and service orchestration.]**

36. Monitoring setup (Prometheus, Grafana) ‚ùå
**[Note: Prometheus and Grafana can run natively or connect to cloud services.]**

37. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests ‚ö†Ô∏è
**[Note: Tests will be run natively within Python environment.]**

38. Simulate failures and fallback chains ‚ö†Ô∏è
