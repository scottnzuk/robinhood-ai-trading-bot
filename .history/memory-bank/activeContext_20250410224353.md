### Current Focus
- Optimized project folder structure:
  - Reorganized code into logical modules (execution, risk_management, etc.)
  - Consolidated duplicate functionality
  - Standardized imports and module interfaces
  - Created proper package structure with __init__.py files
  - Improved maintainability and readability

- Implemented comprehensive anti-gaming system:
  - Created AntiGamingSystem class with multiple protection strategies
  - Implemented order execution randomization (timing, size)
  - Added Iceberg/TWAP/VWAP execution strategies
  - Implemented behavioral noise (decoy orders, cancellations)
  - Added exchange rotation and routing optimization
  - Implemented adaptive parameter adjustment based on market conditions
  - Enhanced circuit breaker protection
  - Added pattern disruption to prevent detection

- Implemented fine-tuning strategy weights based on backtesting results:
  - Created WeightOptimizer class with multiple optimization methods:
    - Grid search for exhaustive parameter exploration
    - Random search for efficient parameter space sampling
    - Genetic algorithm for evolutionary optimization
  - Added performance metrics evaluation for different weight combinations
  - Implemented weight normalization and tournament selection

- Integrated quantized phi model into AI trading engine:
  - Created PhiModel wrapper class for model loading and inference
  - Implemented model ensemble approach in AITradingEngine
  - Added weighted decision combination logic
  - Optimized prompts for phi model's smaller context window
  - Implemented efficient model loading with MPS/CUDA support

- Implemented additional technical strategies:
  - Added BollingerBandsStrategy for volatility-based trading
  - Created MACDStrategy for trend identification and momentum
  - Organized strategies in dedicated package structure
  - Implemented confidence calculation based on signal strength

- Next steps:
  - Test anti-gaming system with simulated market conditions
  - Integrate anti-gaming system with strategy execution
  - Test new strategies with historical data
  - Evaluate ensemble model performance
  - Fine-tune strategy weights using optimization methods

- Maintaining RooFlow memory bank system with five core files:
  - activeContext.md - Current session context
  - decisionLog.md - Architectural decisions
  - productContext.md - Project overview
  - progress.md - Task tracking
  - systemPatterns.md - Recurring patterns

### Recent Changes
- Created unified Strategy Framework in `strategy_framework.py`
- Implemented robust Risk Management System in `risk_management.py`
- Enhanced AI Trading Engine with dynamic prompts in `ai_trading_engine.py`
- Developed Backtesting Framework in `backtesting.py`
- Updated main application to integrate new components
- Consolidated Memory Bank into five core files
- Migrated all important information from specialized documentation files
[2025-04-10 17:39:12] - Memory Bank synchronized upon explicit user request (UMB command issued)

### Open Questions/Issues
- Fine-tuning of strategy weights for optimal performance
- Integration of quantized phi model into AI trading engine
- Optimization of backtesting performance for large datasets
- Refinement of risk parameters based on backtesting results
- Potential expansion to additional asset classes beyond equities
- Removed all placeholder pattern detection code
- Finalized classic strategy implementations (MA, RSI)
- Enhanced circuit breaker logic with multi-metric adaptive thresholds

### Open Questions / Issues
- Missing `tokenizer.model` for some LLaMA checkpoints (hard block)
- Quantized phi model integration pending validation
- Further tuning of ensemble voting between TA-Lib, LLMs, and classic signals
- Additional ONNX threat models to be trained and deployed
- Final performance tuning and stress testing
