### Major Decisions

#### Project Structure Optimization
- **Decision**: Reorganize the project structure to improve maintainability and follow best practices.
- **Rationale**: The codebase had grown organically with some duplication and inconsistent organization. A cleaner structure was needed to support future development and make the codebase more maintainable.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created dedicated packages for major components (execution, risk_management)
  - Moved related files to appropriate directories
  - Created proper package structure with __init__.py files
  - Updated imports in main.py to use the new structure
  - Consolidated duplicate functionality
- **Impact**: Significantly improves code maintainability, reduces cognitive load for developers, and makes the codebase more modular and extensible.

#### Advanced Anti-Gaming System
- **Decision**: Implement a comprehensive anti-gaming system with multiple protection strategies.
- **Rationale**: The previous implementation had basic circuit breaker functionality but lacked sophisticated anti-gaming measures. Market participants can detect patterns in order execution and exploit them, leading to worse execution prices and potential front-running.
- **Implementation**: Created `AntiGamingSystem` class with multiple protection strategies including order execution randomization, Iceberg/TWAP/VWAP execution, behavioral noise, exchange rotation, adaptive parameters, and pattern disruption.
- **Impact**: Significantly improves trade execution quality by making trading patterns unpredictable and preventing other market participants from detecting and exploiting the trading bot's behavior.

#### Strategy Weight Optimization
- **Decision**: Implement a comprehensive weight optimization system with multiple algorithms (grid search, random search, genetic algorithm).
- **Rationale**: Manual weight tuning is time-consuming and suboptimal. Automated optimization allows for data-driven weight selection and adaptation to different market conditions.
- **Implementation**: Created `WeightOptimizer` class in `optimization` package with three optimization methods and performance metric evaluation.
- **Impact**: Enables systematic optimization of strategy weights, leading to improved trading performance and adaptability to changing market conditions.

#### Phi Model Integration
- **Decision**: Integrate the quantized phi model as part of an ensemble approach in the AI trading engine.
- **Rationale**: Relying on a single AI model creates a single point of failure and limits perspective. An ensemble approach combines strengths of different models and improves robustness.
- **Implementation**: Created `PhiModel` wrapper class and enhanced `AITradingEngine` with model ensemble capabilities and weighted decision combination.
- **Impact**: Improves trading decision quality through diversified AI perspectives and reduces dependency on external API providers.

#### Additional Technical Strategies
- **Decision**: Implement Bollinger Bands and MACD strategies in a dedicated strategies package.
- **Rationale**: Expanding the strategy library provides more trading signals and improves the system's ability to adapt to different market conditions.
- **Implementation**: Created `BollingerBandsStrategy` and `MACDStrategy` classes with confidence calculation based on signal strength.
- **Impact**: Enhances the trading system's ability to identify trading opportunities in different market regimes (trending, ranging, volatile).



#### Unified Strategy Framework
- **Decision**: Implement a modular, extensible strategy framework that allows combining multiple trading strategies with weighted signals.
- **Rationale**: Previous implementation had strategies scattered across different modules with inconsistent interfaces, making it difficult to combine signals and maintain code.
- **Implementation**: Created `strategy_framework.py` with base `Strategy` class, signal standardization, and `StrategyRegistry` for weighted combination of signals.
- **Impact**: Enables easy addition of new strategies, creates more robust trading signals through ensemble methods, and improves code maintainability.

#### Comprehensive Risk Management System
- **Decision**: Develop a dedicated risk management system with position sizing, stop-loss/take-profit, and portfolio-level risk controls.
- **Rationale**: Previous implementation lacked systematic risk management, leading to inconsistent position sizes and excessive risk exposure.
- **Implementation**: Created `risk_management.py` with dynamic position sizing based on volatility, confidence, and account value, plus portfolio constraints.
- **Impact**: Significantly improves risk-adjusted returns by protecting capital during adverse market conditions and sizing positions appropriately.

#### Enhanced AI Trading Engine
- **Decision**: Enhance AI integration with dynamic prompts that adapt to market conditions and a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
- **Rationale**: Static prompts were not effective across different market regimes, and there was no mechanism to learn from past trading outcomes.
- **Implementation**: Created `ai_trading_engine.py` with market regime detection, dynamic prompt generation, and performance tracking.
- **Impact**: Makes the trading bot more adaptable to changing market conditions and improves decision quality through contextual awareness.

#### Backtesting Framework
- **Decision**: Develop a comprehensive backtesting system for validating trading strategies on historical data.
- **Rationale**: Needed a way to validate strategies before deploying to live trading to avoid costly mistakes and optimize parameters.
- **Implementation**: Created `backtesting.py` with historical data processing, performance metrics calculation, and trade simulation.
- **Impact**: Enables data-driven strategy selection and optimization, reducing the risk of deploying ineffective strategies.

#### Memory Bank Consolidation
- **Decision**: Consolidate Memory Bank into five core files (activeContext.md, decisionLog.md, productContext.md, progress.md, systemPatterns.md).
- **Rationale**: The previous structure with numerous specialized files made it difficult to maintain and navigate the documentation.
- **Implementation**: Migrated all important information from specialized files into the five core files with a consistent format.
- **Impact**: Improves documentation accessibility and ensures all critical information is properly organized and maintained.

#### Previous Decisions
- **Replaced broken `.pth` classifier** with TA-Lib + LLM ensemble
- **Integrated local Alpaca-LoRA LLaMA model** (quantized, fine-tuned)
- **Integrated local Flan-T5 candle LLM**
- **Cloned quantized phi model repo for future use**
- **Discarded typedduck/ohlcv Rust repo** (non-Python)
- **Discarded incompatible `.pth` transformer model**
- **Implemented adaptive anti-gaming execution with multi-layered defenses**
- **Added multi-metric adaptive circuit breakers**
- **Enabled ensemble threat detection with ONNX models**
- **Automated continuous execution loop without feedback pauses**
- **Switched to TA-Lib for production-grade pattern detection**
- **Extracted classic strategies (MA, RSI) into local module**
- **Integrated multiple local LLMs for candle classification**
- **Set up Memory Bank for persistent context**

### Rationale

- **Speed + accuracy**: TA-Lib + LLM ensemble outperforms broken models
- **Resilience**: Multi-layered defenses + adaptive circuit breakers
- **Extensibility**: Modular plugin architecture, easy model swaps
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, explainability, regulatory safeguards
- **Performance**: Optimized for Apple Silicon, async-first design
- **Autonomy**: Fully autonomous execution without human intervention
