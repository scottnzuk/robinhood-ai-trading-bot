# My Robin Stocks Extensions

This package is designed to **safely extend and customize** the [robin_stocks](https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks) library **without modifying the original cloned repository**.

---

## Why use this?

- **Keep the upstream `robin_stocks` repo pristine** for easy updates or re-cloning.
- **Add new features, bug fixes, or wrappers** without risk.
- **Override or patch existing API calls** in a clean, maintainable way.
- **Organize your own trading logic** separately from the vendor code.

---

## How to use

1. **Import your extension package instead of `robin_stocks` directly:**

```python
import my_robin_stocks_extensions as myrs

# Call your wrapper or extended functions
myrs.my_get_account_info()
```

2. **Add your own modules**
